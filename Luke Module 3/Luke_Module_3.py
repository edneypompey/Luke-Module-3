# write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input, which is an integer, 
# and prints False if n is less than 100, and True if n is greater than or equal to 100

n = int(input("Type a number")) # allows the input after the string
print(n >= 100) #true/false reply if n greater or equal to 100
